# Power BI Project: SQL Case Study - Job Posting Dataset

This repository contains a Power BI project focused on analyzing a dataset related to Job Postings. The project aims to derive insights and visualize key metrics using Power BI reports and dashboards.

## Problem Statement

You need to explore a real-world job posting dataset to uncover insights for a fictional recruitment company called "Data Optimiser". 
You’ll use Power Query to investigate and clean the data to find out what skills are most in-demand for data scientists, data analysts, and data engineers. You’ll then use DAX to build insightful visualizations of your findings. Finally, you’ll bring it all together using everything Power BI has to offer to create a business dashboard so that you can answer questions for the DataSearch team.

## Dataset

For this case study, I was provided a dataset made up of job postings across all job category. Each entry in this dataset’s table corresponds to a specific job posting at a certain point in time, with 19 attributes or columns for each posting. The dataset is comprised of both Qualitative and Quantitative characterized columns. 

For the `Qualitative Columns`, the primary columns include items relevant to a job posting, such as:
1. the ID
2. title
3. type
4. level
5. skills for the job.

For the `Quantitative columns`, the primary columns include
1. date of job posting
2. Experience Level
3. Minimum and maximum Salary
4. No. of appicants who applied for the job
